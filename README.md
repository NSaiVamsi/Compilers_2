1. In P1:  
   P1 is basiclly making our own lexical analyser for a given language which is a varient of C(let's say P)

   One of them is the token stream generated by my lexical analyser for language P  
   Other one is converting codes in Lang P to C lang, which is not exactly accurate but works till functionalities
